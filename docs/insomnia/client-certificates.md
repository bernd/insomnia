Client certificates are used by some APIs to as a means of authentication. Unetus supports assigning a client certificate to a specific domain name and will automatically use them automatically whenever a request to that domain is sent.

## Import Certificates

Unetus supports `PFX` (Mac) and `PEM` (Windows and Linux) certificates. 

To import a new certificate, click **Document Settings** or **Collection Settings** then the **Client Certificates** tab.

_Depending on whether you are working with a Document or Collection, access client certificate settings via Document Settings or Collection Settings._

Once you click **New Certificate** in the **Client Certificates** tab, you will be prompted to fill out the following information. 

* `Host`: certificate will be sent when the host (and port if specified) matches
* `PFX`: certificate in `PFX` or `PKCS12` format (only supported on Mac)
* `CRT File + Key File`: certificate and key pair (only supported on Windows and Linux)
* `Passphrase`: An optional passphrase for the certificate, if required

After importing a certificate, it will show up in the main certificates list in the **Client Certificates** tab. From here, the certificate can be enabled, disabled, or deleted.
